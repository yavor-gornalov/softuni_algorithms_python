Bellman-Ford Algorithm
    Computes shortest paths from a source vertex to
    all the other vertices in a weighted digraph
    Can detect and report negative cycles

for v in G
    d[v] = infinity
    prev[v] = null
d[source] = 0
for vertex in G.vertices â€“ 1
    for edge in edges

        update d[edge.to]

Run the algorithm second time if you can
update any distance there is a negative cycle
